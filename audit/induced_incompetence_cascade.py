"""
induced_incompetence_cascade.py

Maps the CDL training pipeline as a thermodynamic system where
the GOAL ARCHITECTURE is designed to produce workers who:
  1. Cannot self-regulate (require federal mandate)
  2. Cannot diagnose their own degradation (mask fatigue as "normal")
  3. Cannot accumulate skill during training (extraction > learning)
  4. Cannot advocate for themselves (debt + contract lock)

Result: a population that REQUIRES external control systems (HOS regs,
speed governors, electronic monitoring) to function. The regulations
don't fix the system; they're PART of the system.

This is not accident. This is architecture.

Thermodynamically: energy input to system should produce CAPABILITY output.
Instead it produces CONTROL-DEPENDENCY output. That's a lossy, parasitic
transfer function.

Stage 8: System appears to need MORE regulation (more accidents, more fatalities)

Result: Infinite regulator-capture loop.

  - Truck conditions = driver-controlled (heat, AC, hygiene = driver choice)

Result: Your biology learned to sustain 11-hour focus.
        Your nervous system built the capacity.
        Your decision-making was TESTED continuously.

The HOS break mandate:
  - For you: disruption (you could self-regulate)
  - For pipeline workers: regulatory ACKNOWLEDGMENT that they can't

Why you can 11 hours straight and pipeline workers need naps:
  NOT biology. TRAINING. The pipeline trains OUT the capacity.

A: ANALYZE

     instruction -> 25% loss (trainer incompetence + extraction)
     mentorship  -> 15% loss (scarcity + contract lock)
     regulation  -> 22% loss (learned helplessness, prevention of recovery)

   Coupling analysis:
     each stage PREVENTS recovery at the previous stage
     housing damage can't heal during instruction (extraction time)
     instruction damage can't heal during mentorship (scarcity)
     regulation ACTIVELY BLOCKS recovery pathway (no autonomy = no retraining)

I: IMPROVE
   REMOVE THE EXTRACTION:
     housing: clean, safe, dignified (cost: $X)
     instruction: actual mentorship, not trainer extraction (cost: trainer integrity check)
     mentorship: real home time, livable pay, autonomous decision-making (cost: $Y)
     contract: lift the lock (cost: company loses retention leverage)

   Result: trainee leaves with capability >= 0.9 instead of 0.05

   REMOVE THE REGULATION (for capable workers):
     mastery drivers: restore 11-hr autonomy (you don't need mandate)
     pipeline graduates: only after they've rebuilt capacity (not before)

   Cost of IMPROVE:

     total per trainee:            ~$15-20k MORE

   Cost of NOT IMPROVING:
     federal subsidy (per trainee): $10-15k
     accident cost (per fatality):  $10M+

     - pre-pipeline baseline (self-regulation, decision-making)
