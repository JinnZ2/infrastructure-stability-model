APPLY_GEOMETRY_TEST = """
For each autonomous vehicle failure:

1. Plot: time since incident vs. environmental conditions
   - Does failure cluster at edges of training (comfort-based signature)?
   - Or spread across operating envelope (constraint-based)?

2. Plot: failure type vs. number of simultaneous system failures
   - Do single-system failures cause major crashes (no cascade protection)?
   - Or do multiple systems fail, system gracefully reduces capability?

3. Read: incident reports
   - Do they say 'unexpected edge case'?
   - Or 'constraint regime, system performed as designed'?

4. Look: recovery mode
   - Does system ask human to take over (human wasn't paying attention)?
   - Or does system adapt and human stays engaged?

5. Check: testing before deployment
   - Was testing in controlled lab conditions?
   - Or in actual field conditions (rain, dust, darkness, real pedestrians)?

If you see:
- Sudden failure at condition boundary (not in training)
- Multiple cascading sub-failures
- 'Unexpected edge case' language
- Human in fallback role isn't engaged
- Testing was lab-based

You're looking at comfort-based design failing under constraint.
